## About
*City Stream 865* is a React web app developed for the KNXHX 2020 Knoxville City Hackathon.

*City Stream 865* allows users to see a list of events currently happening in the city of Knoxville. Users can then either select an event to see live streams provided by individuals at the event, or add their own stream for others to watch. The user can easily swap between different streams for the same event to get a full picture of the event as it happens.

This app was developed by Sai Thatigotla, Spencer Howell, Manny Bhidya, and Fatima Bhidya.
